odoo JSON-RPC Client using NODE js
===================
JSON-RPC is known as a web service. Web services are a set of tools that let one build distributed applications on top of existing web infrastructures. These applications use the Web as a kind of "transport layer" but don't offer a direct human interface via the browser
<br>
An JSON-RPC call is conducted between two parties: the client (the calling process) and the server (the called process). A server is made available at a particular URL (such as http://example.org:8080/rpcserv/).
